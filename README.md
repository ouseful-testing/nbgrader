# nbgrader
*nbgrader test environment*

Minimal example of setting up a standalone `nbgrader` environment. This *does not* include a default course identifier so releasing and collecting notebooks is not handled automatically.

This branch demonstrates a marker configuration with `nbgrader` files managed in a specified directory.
