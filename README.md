# nbgrader
*nbgrader test environment*

Minimal example of setting up a standalone `nbgrader` environment. This *does not* include a default course identifier so releasing and collecting notebooks is not handled automatically.

Simple demo built against the `nbgrader` repo master rather than PyPi package.
