# nbgrader
*nbgrader test environment*

Minimal example of setting up a standalone `nbgrader` environment. This *does not* include a default course identifier so releasing and collecting notebooks is not handled automatically.

Simple config that attempts to provide a minimal environment for creating `nbgrader` assignment notebooks.
